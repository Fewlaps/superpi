# SuperPI
If you are a hardware nerd like me, you know SuperPI for sure. If not, SuperPI is a Windows application useful to benchmark your CPU.

As there's any simple way to benchmark servers performance, we written this project that tests your CPU without installing nothing: simply running the image on Docker

```bash
docker run fewlaps/superpi
```

By default, the app runs 32 threads and 1000000000 iterations over the Gauss-Legendre algorithm to approximate the Pi decimals. If you want to customize that numbers, don't hesitate to do it:

```bash
docker run fewlaps/superpi -t numberOfThreads
docker run fewlaps/superpi -i numberOfIterations
docker run fewlaps/superpi -t numberOfThreads -i numberOfIterations
```

## Some results

Running the default test on different machines took...
- Windows desktop, Mid 2013, 3.5 GHz i7: **33,586 ms**
- MacBook Pro 13", Late 2013, 2.4 Ghz i5 **85.998 ms**
- MacBook Pro 13", Early 2015, 3.1 GHz i7: **64,973 ms**
- MacBook Air 13", Mid 2012, 1.8 GHz i5: **93,775 ms**

(This results are running the jar on the host, not via the Docker image. We've seen that Docker is really slow compared with running the .jar on the host. Do you have any idea about fixing it? Here's the [Stackoverflow Question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39089850) :Â·)
